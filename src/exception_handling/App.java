//Initial questions having watched the tutorial once

//1) should you handle exceptions on every method??? I think the answer is no but why not...?
//2) what is the difference between Throwable and Exception? When would you use one and not the other?
//3) When would you use a try/catch instead of a throw? Can you give me some examples of what 'other code' you'd want to execute in the catch body?
